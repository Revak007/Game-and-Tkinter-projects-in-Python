# Game-and-Tkinter-projects-in-Python
This repo will contain all of my smaller side projects in Python, including the creation of a calculator using TKinter, Python's 
most commonly used GUI interface. You can find how to use Tkinter at the following link: https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html
All code used Python 3.7, and was written in Jupyter Notebook. You can get Jupyter Notebook by downloading Anaconda.
